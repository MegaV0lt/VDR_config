# Parameters for VDR plugin mp3

# The default mount script is "mount.sh". This script is called from the
# plugin with 2 options on commandline. The first is
# one of mount/unmount/eject/status and gives the action to perform. The
# second one is the base directory as defined in "mplayersources.conf".
# The script must return the exit code 0 if the action was
# successfull and 1 if the action failed (see the comments in the example
# "mount.sh" script which comes with the archive).
