# Parameters for VDR plugin mplayer

# MPlayer is called through a skript called "mplayer.sh" with the filename to
# play as first argument and the phrase SLAVE as second argument if SlaveMode
# is enabled.
# The skript has to call MPlayer with all the necessary options.
MPLAYER="/etc/vdr/plugins/mplayer/mplayer.sh"

# The default mount script is "mount.sh". This script is called from the
# plugin with 2 options on commandline. The first is
# one of mount/unmount/eject/status and gives the action to perform. The
# second one is the base directory as defined in "mplayersources.conf".
# The script must return the exit code 0 if the action was
# successfull and 1 if the action failed (see the comments in the example
# "mount.sh" script which comes with the archive).
MOUNT="/etc/vdr/plugins/mp3/mount.sh"
